    <h2>BE Computer Science And Engineering</h2><br>
    <br><p>Department of Computer Science & Engineering was established in the year 1999 which is NBA Accredited and also Affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum and Approved by AICTE, New Delhi (Recognized by the Government of Karnataka). The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is one of the best popular courses offered among engineering aspirants which mainly focuses on computation, analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networks and problem solving skills. This program has roots in electrical, electronics and communication engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. The Computer Engineers design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems for various businesses, scientific and social contexts.</p>
    <br><p>ABC’s B.E in Computer science and Engineering is one of the top rated programs. The program imparts the fundamentals of Computer Science through a set of core courses. It also equips the students in their chosen specialization, through a set of electives. Computer science engineering is the study of software, hardware and theoretical aspects of computing devices. Also it includes the study of the application of computing in scientific, engineering, business and other areas. Computer engineers do many different types of work which helps for the Society, to develop Software for Social Security, improving Mobile Devices and other Computerized Technologies. </p>
    <br><p>The Department of Computer science and Engineering has signed MOU’s with various organizations to provide live projects for Engineering Students of UG & PG final year students. Industrial visits, workshops, Seminars, International Conferences and mini-projects for students are also encouraged by the department in various sectors. Every semester students are taken out for industrial visits to know about the latest trends and Technologies to make them organization ready for the best placement. To name a few, visits made on frequent basis to organizations like ISRO, C-DAC, Kaynes Technology, INFOSYS etc.</p>
